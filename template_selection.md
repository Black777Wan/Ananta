# Web Application Template Selection

## Requirements Analysis

Based on our MVP features for the Roam Research-like note-taking app, we need a template that supports:

1. **Data Persistence**: Notes, backlinks, and page references must be stored persistently
2. **Backend Processing**: Managing relationships between notes, generating backlinks
3. **User Interface**: Interactive markdown editor with real-time preview
4. **Data Structure**: Hierarchical block-based content storage

## Template Options Considered

According to the Web Application Template Selection Guide, we have two main options:

### 1. React (For Frontend/Static Applications)
- **Pros**: 
  - Excellent for interactive UIs
  - Built-in state management
  - Rich ecosystem of markdown and editor components
- **Cons**:
  - Limited built-in data persistence (would require external services or complex local storage)
  - No built-in server-side processing

### 2. Flask Application (For Backend/Database Applications)
- **Pros**:
  - Built-in database support
  - Server-side processing for complex operations
  - Can serve both API and frontend
  - Structured project organization
- **Cons**:
  - Requires more setup for frontend interactivity
  - May need additional frontend libraries

## Selected Template: Flask Application

**Justification**:

1. **Data Requirements**: Our note-taking app needs robust data persistence and relationship management between notes, which is better handled by a database-backed application.

2. **Backlinks Processing**: Generating and maintaining backlinks requires server-side processing to analyze content across all notes, making Flask's backend capabilities essential.

3. **Future Scalability**: As we expand beyond the MVP to include features like graph visualization and advanced search, having a proper backend will be increasingly important.

4. **Project Structure**: The Flask template provides a clear separation between data models, routes, and frontend, which aligns well with our application's architecture needs.

## Implementation Plan

We will use the pre-installed shell command `create_flask_app` to set up our project with the following structure:

```
note_taking_app/
├── venv/                  # Virtual environment
├── src/
│   ├── models/            # Database models for notes, blocks, links
│   ├── routes/            # API endpoints and page routes
│   ├── static/            # Frontend assets, JS, CSS
│   │   ├── js/            # Client-side JavaScript for editor
│   │   └── css/           # Styling
│   ├── templates/         # HTML templates
│   └── main.py            # Application entry point
└── requirements.txt       # Dependencies
```

For the frontend interactive components, we will integrate appropriate JavaScript libraries within the Flask application to handle markdown editing, preview, and block-based editing.
