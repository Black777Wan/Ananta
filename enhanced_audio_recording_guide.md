## Audio Sources and the Live Mixer

### Automatic Source Detection

The system automatically detects and captures from multiple audio sources:

1. **Microphone**: Your computer's microphone input
2. **System Audio**: Sound from your computer (where browser-supported)
3. **Other Input Devices**: Any additional audio input devices connected to your computer

### Live Mixer Visualization

When you hover over the record button:

1. A panel appears showing all detected audio sources
2. Each source has a real-time visualization showing current audio levels
3. Level bars change color based on volume (green for low, yellow for medium, red for high)
4. This helps you confirm that all desired sources are active before recording

## Playing Back Audio

### From Individual Bullets

1. Each bullet point created during a recording session will have a small play button next to it
2. Click this button to start playback from the exact moment that bullet was created
3. The audio player will appear at the bottom right of the screen

### Using the Audio Player

The audio player provides:

1. Play/pause controls
2. A progress bar for navigation
3. Current time and total duration display
4. A close button to dismiss the player

## Technical Considerations

### Browser Support

- **Microphone recording**: Supported in all modern browsers
- **System audio recording**: Best supported in Chrome and Edge
- **Live mixer visualization**: Works in all modern browsers

### Permissions

- Your browser will ask for permission to access your microphone
- For system audio recording, you'll need to select "Share audio" when prompted
- These permissions may need to be granted each session depending on your browser settings

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Check the mixer before recording**: Hover over the record button to verify all sources are active
2. **Create new bullets for key points**: Each new bullet creates a new timestamp marker
3. **Use the live mixer to monitor levels**: Ensure your audio isn't too quiet or clipping
4. **Review recordings**: Use the bullet play buttons to quickly jump to relevant parts

## Troubleshooting

- **No audio sources in mixer**: Ensure your microphone is properly connected and permissions are granted
- **Can't see the record button**: Try refreshing the page or clearing your browser cache
- **No system audio**: This feature depends on browser support; try using Chrome or Edge
- **Playback issues**: If audio doesn't play, try refreshing the page or checking your audio output settings

Enjoy your enhanced note-taking experience with seamless audio recording and visualization!
